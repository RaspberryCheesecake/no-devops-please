Before we start
============================================================

Please check the requirements below, which are for Docker. It *is* possible to use older hardware and software, using
Virtual Box and Docker Toolbox - but it can require quite a bit of extra work to set up.

Macintosh users
---------------

* a 2010 or newer model. Run the command ``sysctl kern.hv_support`` to check for the required hardware
  virtualisation support (the response should be ``1``).
* macOS Sierra 10.12 or newer


Windows users
--------------

* virtualisation enabled in BIOS
* Windows 10 64bit Pro, Enterprise or Education


Linux users
-----------

You'll probably be OK...
