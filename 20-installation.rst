   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. _installation:

Installation
============================================================

Please install:

* the `Divio app <http://divio.com/app>`_ - the nice thing about this is that it will also install Docker and other
  components for you

or if you prefer to have more control:

* Docker for Mac/Docker for Windows/Docker CE for your Linux
* the Divio CLI: ``pip install divio-cli``

(You can of course do both. And you don't need to do them right now anyway.)
