Deploying to the cloud
============================================================

You might be used to having direct access to, and control of, your project in deployment, or deployed your projects in
an interactive way, step-by-step. In a containerised system - you don't. You can't manipulate or interact with it
directly .

All you can do is send it the instructions you want it to follow, and tell it to execute them - your attention must now
be on *writing good instructions*, rather than undertaking the task yourself.
