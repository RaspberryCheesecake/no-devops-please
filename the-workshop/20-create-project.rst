Create a project to work with
============================================================

..  note::

    Before starting, please see :ref:`requirements`.


Using the Divio Control Panel (you will need an account, it's free), `create a new project
<https://control.divio.com/control/project/create>`_.

Select the defaults:

* *Platform*: ``Python 3.6``
* *Type*: ``Django``

You can use Divio's Git server (also the default).

Hit **Skip** in the *Subscription* view.

After a few moments, you'll be presented with its dashboard, which will look something like this:
