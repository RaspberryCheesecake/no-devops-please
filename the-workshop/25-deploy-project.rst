Deploy your project
============================================================

The project exists, but isn't actually running yet. Let's deploy it: hit **Deploy** for the test server.

This will take about three or four minutes.


Visit the *Test* site
-----------------------

You can use the link in the Control Panel to access the *Test* server of your project.

You can now log in to the Django admin.
